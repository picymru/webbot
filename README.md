# webbot - A simple browser controlled robot

This is a very simple Python based robot project for the Raspberry Pi designed for use with the Cam Jam 3 robotics kit. Using gpiozero and CherryPy the program will host it's own web page which can be used to control the robot.

## Kit
 - [Raspberry Pi](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b)
 - [CamJam EduKit 3 - Robotics Kit](https://thepihut.com/products/camjam-edukit-3-robotics)
 - [Official Raspberry Pi Camera](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-camera/products/raspberry-pi-camera-module) (optional but recommended)
 - Wi-Fi connection (Built into the Raspberry Pi 3), or Ethernet connection

## Installation
We've made installing everything you need to get started with our browser controlled robot easy!

	git clone https://github.com/picymru/webbot.git
	cd webbot
	make install

## Usage
Running the project is easy. From your Raspberry Pi command line, run the following:

	python3 webbot.py

Once running, the software will display a web address for you to connect to. By default, and for security purposes, the software will only initially allow connections from the web browser running on the Raspberry Pi by visiting http://localhost:5000

If you know what you're doing, and would like to expose the interface to all devices running on your network, then run the software using the following:

	python3 webbot.py -i 0.0.0.0

This will allow you to control the robot from any device on the same network as your Raspberry Pi at http://raspberrypi.lan:5000

### Control
Once connected in your browser, by default, you can use the following keys on your keyboard to control the robot:

- Arrow keys for forwards, backwards, left turn and right turn
- 'c' key to capture and display an image from the camera if connected
- 'u' key to turn on/off an ultrasonic distance measurement every 2 seconds
